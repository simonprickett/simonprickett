# Simon Prickett

Hi - thanks for dropping by. I'm Simon Prickett, an experienced software professional.

I'm currently employed as the Developer Advocacy Manager for [Redis](https://redis.com) where I lead the team that develops course materials and accompanying example applications, videos and blog posts for our online [Redis University](https://university.redis.com) courses. I'm the principal teacher for the [Redis for JavaScript (Node.js) Developers course](https://university.redis.com/courses/ru102js/), and have also contributed to the [Redis Streams](https://university.redis.com/courses/ru202/) and [Redis for Java Developers](https://university.redis.com/courses/ru102j/) courses.

Outside of my day job, I enjoy tinkering with Raspberry Pi and Arduino single board computers and building hardware projects with them. I recently acquired a BBC micro:bit and need to spend some time learning about that. I periodically write about IoT topics and speak at Meetup groups or conferences.

Check out my website at [simonprickett.dev](https://simonprickett.dev).  You can also find me as [@simon_prickett](https://twitter.com/simon_prickett) on Twitter (account currently inactive), and in a [few other places](https://simonprickett.dev/contact/).
