# Simon Prickett

Hi - thanks for dropping by. I'm Simon Prickett, an experienced software professional based in sunny San Diego, California USA.

I'm currently working as a Curriculum Engineer for Redis Labs where I develop course materials and accompanying example applications for our online Redis University courses. I'm the principal teacher for the Redis for JavaScript (Node.js) Developers course, and have also contributed to the Redis Streams and Redis for Java Developers courses.

I've been coding since I received a Sinclair ZX Spectrum as a Christmas present in the early 1980s. I have particularly fond memories of owning and developing software for the Atari ST and Commodore Amiga. I was part of a team that made a popular infinite shooter game for the Arduboy, and have also worked on Nintendo Gameboy Advance projects.

Outside of my day job, I enjoy tinkering with Raspberry Pi and Arduino single board computers and building hardware projects with them. I recently acquired a BBC micro:bit and need to spend some time learning about that. I periodically write about IoT topics and speak at Meetup groups or conferences.
