# Simon Prickett

Hi - thanks for dropping by. I'm Simon Prickett, an experienced developer relations professional.

I'm currently employed as the Principal Developer Advocate for [Redis](https://redis.com) where I lead the team that develops course materials and accompanying example applications, videos and blog posts for our online [Redis University](https://university.redis.com) courses. I'm the principal teacher for the [Redis for JavaScript (Node.js) Developers course](https://university.redis.com/courses/ru102js/), and have also contributed to the [Redis Streams](https://university.redis.com/courses/ru202/), [Storing Querying and Indexing JSON at Speed](https://university.redis.com/courses/ru204/) and [Redis for Java Developers](https://university.redis.com/courses/ru102j/) courses.

Outside of my day job, I enjoy tinkering with Raspberry Pi and Arduino single board computers and building hardware projects with them. I recently acquired a BBC micro:bit and need to spend some time learning about that. I periodically write about IoT topics and speak at Meetup groups or conferences.

Check out my website at [simonprickett.dev](https://simonprickett.dev).  You can also find me as [@simon_prickett](https://twitter.com/simon_prickett) on Twitter, and in a [few other places](https://simonprickett.dev/contact/).  I'm always open to talk about developer relations, learn more about me by [reading my resume](https://simonprickett.dev/resume/).

One way of achieving this would be to move more things that we use electricity for (cooking, charging electric vehicles, washing clothes etc) to times when our electricity generation was as green as possible. To do this, weâ€™d need a way of knowing when those times are so that we could take manual or automated action... **[Read in full...](https://simonprickett.dev/carbon-intensity-display-with-raspberry-pi-pico-and-pimoroni-gfx-pack/)**
